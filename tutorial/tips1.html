    <h1>Welcome to <a href="landingPage1.html"> tips!</a></h1>
    <p class="explanation"> This explains a little bit
      about how this application works! </p>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <div class="box1">
      <p class="tip1">First, choose whatever progression that you
        would like to have <span class="example">(ex. Major, Minor, Diminished)</span>
        and then type the chord that you want to experiment with
        into the text field or click the piano. The result will be the chord names
        dislpayed on the screen and colored on the piano.
      </p>
    </div>


  <div class="box2">
    <p class="tip2">The other options for chord progressions
      <span class="example"> (djfkldajf;j) </span> are not-your-average-
      kind-of-chords. These chords are more out there and a lot more
      different! Don't be afraid to experiment :)
    </p>
  </div>




  <div class="box3">
    <p class="tip3">Try as many chords as you want! But if you hear
      something that you like, make sure that you take note of it, as
      the chords will disappear if you start to use another chord.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="box4">
    <p class="tip4">For chord inversion,
      you just move the lowest notes to the other notes in the chord.
      For example, triads can be inverted by moving the lowest notes up an octave.
    </p>
  </div>


  <div class="box5">
    <p class="tip5">A chord progression is a series of chords played in a sequence;
      the harmonic functions of chords within a key is compared to the tonic of the key,
      and thus they are denoted with Roman Numerals.
