# Chord Master

## Project Vision

### What are you building? 

We are building a teaching and exploring tool for musicians to search and experiment with different types of chords. Our application, Chord Master, boosts musician to learn chords from the beginner to the master. It would help musicians to discover new chords and inspire their next songs. 

### What problem does it solve?

Many musicians start their music creation as a hobby, but they may lack necessary music theory background to help them go further in their music career. Our goal is to make the process of learning chords easy and interesting, and let musicians benefit most from the knowledge. Our product will help musicians inexperienced with music theory to get familiar with chords and let the knowledge as their source of inspiration.

### What will it do?

The application is a piano keyboard with chord hints. The user can select the type of the chord (i.e. Minor, Major) or the types of music they want the chords to fit in. After pressing a key on the keyboard, the application will find a matching chord. Then, it will highlight the keys of the chords starting with the root key on the keyboard, and plays the sounds of the keys of the chords. In this approach, the user can find a chord easily, learn a chord interactively, and explores chords beyond a standard one.

### Who is the end user?

The end users are musicians who are looking to expand their repertoire of chords, making more interesting and creative music.  The main target we are looking at right now is talented musicians and digital audio producers with little theory background because although they tend to have less knowledge of chords, they are still very capable of creating amazing music. Our application will help them get started on the chords quickly and make full use of the chords knowledge.
